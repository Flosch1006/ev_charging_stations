# GEOJSON Data for German Administrative Districts

The geojson file containing the polygon data for the visualization has been downloaded from [Berkeley Library](https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/stanford-nz271ny2119) on December 1st 2022. The decision to not use a live link to the dataset that would enable updates was taken because the link is only provided to the user when clicking the "GEOJSON". This link only remains valid for a certain period of time. The application is designed in a way to use the link as long as it works, but uses the saved data as a backup option via a try-except-statement.
