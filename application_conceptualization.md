# Application Conceptualization
As the world progresses on its way to electrification, individual transport plays a key part as it accounts for about [https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/verkehr/fahrleistungen-verkehrsaufwand-modal-split#fahrleistung-im-personen-und-guterverkehr](600 billion road kilometers traveled per year). With this magnitude, it is a key contributor to transportation emissions which need to be reduced in the context of climate change. A [https://efahrer.chip.de/news/umfrage-raeumt-mit-vorurteil-auf-die-deutschen-wollen-e-autos_109074#:~:text=27%20Prozent%20der%20Befragten%2C%20die,gegen%20den%20Kauf%20eines%20Elektroautos.](major inhibitor) for adoption of electrical cars is the fragile and underdeveloped charging station infrastructure. Therefore, it is critical to identify gaps in the existing charging station infrastructure to enable widespread adoption of electrical cars.
## Research Question
> ***Where are the gaps in the current charging station infrastructure?***
## Data Requirements
The problem at hand is a classical demand vs. supply problem. Therefore, both the demand and the supply need to be quantified. The supply (charging stations) can be obtained in the form of a complete list of all existing and currently operating charging stations. The demand is more difficult to quantify, as there hardly is data on registration available to the public. Hence, the demand has to be estimated using a proxy variable. In the case at hand, this proxy will be the total count of registered cars.
## Granularity
Charging station data is available as point data, meaning there is latitude and a longitude provided for each station. Registered car counts are available on municipality level (fourth administrative layer) and can be aggregated on any higher administrative layer. The goal is to aggregate and join the two datasets on the lowest granularity level possible  to enable drill-down and roll-up features.
## Features
The application should allow the user to scan a map of Germany on a rather detailed level of administrative granularity for gaps in the charging station infrastructure. Also, it provides the user with the ability to filter for the type of charging station, differentiating between regular and fast-charge stations.
